# GGIE
Glass to Glass Internet Ecosystem for video

GGIE is an effort to build a technical community in the IETF and else where around use of the Internet in video creation, editing, and delivery via streaming. It's not a current IETF working group, but this is currently a lot of activity in IETF areas which are directly used in the video workflow.
